# ZeLDa - A Linker in pure Python

This project is a learning exercise to learn how linkers work. The goal of this is not speed or completeness of features.
It is purely as a learning exercise and tool. My hope is that this tool is written in such a way that it can be used
by others to learn how linkers work.


## TODO
1. Be able to parse ELF files
2. Write linking logic
